# Group Project - ActivityFinder

ActivityFinder (temp name) is going to be an app  that helps indecisive individuals to pick activites while out with friends/family. Sometimes, we end up taking too much time to decide on what to do and this app will make it easier for people to decide an activity by generating an activity from user's lists, according to the user input of time, money, and distance/location. We are thinking of using the Yelp API to get general information and description of businesses/locations.

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories(required)
Individual:(user)
- [x] User can sign up and login (JJ)
- [x] User can retrieve their Lists of activities (getLists()-JJ and Justin, display lists-Melissa and Michelle)
- [x] User can create an activity List (Melissa and Michelle)
- [x] User can add Activity into a List (Melissa and Michelle)
- [] User can edit activity description
- [] User can search for description from our app (which will integrate the Yelp database)
- [] User can edit information such as location, duration, cost, group size(big vs small group vs individual)
- [] User can like a List from different users(so lists are public, kinda like how spotify playlists are)
- [] User can like an Activity from his/her own List
- [] User can push a button to generate an activity from their List(s)
- [] User can use map to see their activities


## Optional user stories
- [] User can use camera to take picture of activities
- [] Users can like or dislike an activity and we sort initial list of activities based on number of likes
- [] User can choose between different random search modes:
- [] Individual Explore: from top 3 lists
- [x]User will have a profile with their list of activities(the activities they have done) and maybe even some friends list
- [] Users can see if their friends also plan on going to the same activity, so they can go together

## Database/ API
