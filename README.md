# Group Project - ActivityFinder

ActivityFinder(temp name) is going to be an app for indecisive people to pick activites while out with friends/family. Sometimes, we end up taking too much time just deciding what to do and this app will make it easier for people to decide an activity by generating a list of activities according to the user input of time, money, and distance/location. We are thinking of using the yelp API to come up with the initial list of businesses. 

Time spent: **X** hours spent in total

## User Stories(required)
-Individual:(user)
-User can sign up 
-User can retrieve their Lists of activities
-User can create an activity List
-User can add Activity into a List
-User can edit activity description 
-User can search for description from our app (which will integrate the Yelp database)
-User can edit information such as location, duration, cost, group size(big vs small group vs individual)
-User can like a List from different users(so lists are public, kinda like how spotify playlists are)
-User can like an Activity from his/her own List
-User can push a button to generate an activity from their List(s)



## (the app) --> stuff we(the app admins) can do
-create database of users
-create some fake database of activities/pull stuff from yelp
-save user account info

## some cool and optional user stories 
-users can like or dislike an activity and we sort initial list of activities based on number of likes
-User can choose between different random search modes:
  -Individual Explore: from top 3 lists 
-User will have a profile with their list of activities(the activities they have done) and maybe even some friends list
-Users can see if their friends also plan on going to the same activity, so they can go together
