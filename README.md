# SPARK the Adventurer in You 

Spark is an productivity iOS app in which it helps you to make a decision, whether it's to choose a movie to watch or to go to eat at a restaurant. This app is inspired by the time wasted on deciding what to do/ where to go. Now with Spark, you can save that time for actually enjoying the activities. Less thinking and more doing! 

The app has three main features: Explore where you can find awesome list/ activity to add to your own, Your List where you can create new list and add activity and also where your list/ activity from Explore can be saved. Once you have a list of things you want to do, the rest can be taken care of by our Shuffle feature. Shuffle, as its name implies, will help you pick out an activity based on your saved options such as cost, location... 

Spark - Adventures await!
